# Predicting Abnormal Heart Perfusion
This is my final project for IDS 702: Modeling and Representation of Data at Duke University. This course covered a broad variety of statistical models including hierarchial models, decision trees, and simpler techniques such as regression and hypothesis testing. For my project, I chose to build a logistic regression model that predicts if patients have [heart perfusion abnormalities](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/myocardial-perfusion-scan-stress). The code for the project is located in the [R Markdown file](Predicting Perfusion.Rmd). The final report is contained in the file entitled [Perfusion Prediction](/joekrinke15/Predicting-Thalassemia/blob/master/Predicting Perfusion.Rmd).
