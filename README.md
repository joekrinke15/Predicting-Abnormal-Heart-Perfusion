This is my final project for IDS 702: Modeling and Representation of Data at Duke University. This course covered a broad variety of statistical models including hierarchial models, decision trees, and simpler techniques such as regression and hypothesis testing. For my project, I chose to build a logistic regression model that predicts if patients have [heart perfusion abnormalities](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/myocardial-perfusion-scan-stress). Prediction of such abnormalities could lead to reduced costs associated with testing nad better health outcomes for patients. The project code can be found [here](https://github.com/joekrinke15/Predicting-Abnormal-Heart-Perfusion/blob/master/Predicting%20Perfusion.Rmd), and a pdf of the final report is located [here](https://github.com/joekrinke15/Predicting-Abnormal-Heart-Perfusion/blob/master/Predicting-Perfusion-Final.pdf).
